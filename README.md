Linked List Problems
This repository contains solutions to three linked list problems implemented in C++.

Problem 1: Detect Cycle in a Linked List
Given the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it. Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list, otherwise return false.

Problem 2: Detect the Node Where the Cycle Begins
Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

Problem 3: Reverse a Linked List
Write a function that takes the head of a linked list and returns the reversed list.

This README file provides a brief overview of the three linked list problems included in the repository. Each problem is briefly described along with its expected input and output.

Feel free to expand upon this README file with additional details, usage instructions, or examples as needed.
